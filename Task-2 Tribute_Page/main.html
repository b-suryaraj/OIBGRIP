            <p class="about1">☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Indian mathematician and astronomer who was born in 476 AD; Aryabhata called himself a native of Kusumapura or Pataliputra (present day Patna, Bihar).<br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost. <br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Aryabhatiya</strong>, his major work, is a compendium of mathematics and astronomy. The mathematical part of the Aryabhatiya covers arithmetic, algebra, plane trigonometry, spherical trigonometry, continued fractions, quadratic equations, sums-of-power series, and a table of sines.
            <br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>Arya-siddhanta</strong>, a lost work on astronomical computations, contained a description of several astronomical instruments: the gnomon (shanku-yantra), a shadow instrument (chhAyA-yantra), semicircular and circular (dhanur-yantra / chakra-yantra), an umbrella-shaped device called the chhatra-yantra.<br><br>

            <p class="about2">☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>place-value system</strong>, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali manuscript. While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that <strong>knowledge of zero</strong> was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.<br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aryabhata worked on the <strong>approximation for pi (π)</strong>, and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. In the second part of the Aryabhatiyam (gaṇitapāda 10).<br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Indeterminate equations</strong>; to find integer solutions to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c had been a major problem. Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the kuṭṭaka method. Kuṭṭaka means "pulverising" or "breaking into small pieces", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for writing the original factors in smaller numbers.

            <p class="about3">☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aryabhata described a <strong>geocentric model of the solar system</strong>, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the Paitāmahasiddhānta, the motions of the planets are governed by two epicycles, a smaller manda (slow) and a larger śīghra (fast).<br><br>
            ☛&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Solar</strong> and <strong>lunar eclipses</strong> were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu and Ketu, he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast by and falling on Earth.
